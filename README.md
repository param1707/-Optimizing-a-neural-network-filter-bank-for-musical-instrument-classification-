The goal of this project is to optimize the hyperparameters of a Neural Network Filter Bank  used in the classification of musical instruments.
The network architecture is composed by an encoder/analysis convolutional layer filter bank section, a convolutional classifier section and a decoder or a synthesis  convolutional layer section.
The objective of the optimization is to have the best reconstruction quality possible, and the best classification possible using the smallest number of  trainable parameters possible.
